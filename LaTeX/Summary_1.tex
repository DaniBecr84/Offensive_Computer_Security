\section{Risk}
Risk = Threat x Vulnerability

\begin{quote}
``Risk is a function of the likelihood of a given thread-source's exercising a particular potential vulnerability, and the resulting impact of that adverse event on the organisation.''
\end{quote}

Threat: consequences of bad thing happening\\
Vulnerability: probability of bad thing happening

\section{Hacking versus Penetration testing}
